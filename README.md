Deep learning phenotyping of brassica and relatives, via semi-synthetic data.

Example Train and Test/Inference scripts in `train.py` and `test.py`, with model script and weights at `model.py` and `deepcanola.pth`.

Training and inference engine code taken from `torchvision` reference scripts, with `engine.py` edited to allow for phenotyping output..

Examples on using scripts show in `inference.sh` and `train.sh`.
