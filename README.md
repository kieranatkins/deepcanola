# DeepCanola
Code and model weights associated with the publication _DeepCanola: Phenotyping Brassica Pods Using Semi-Synthetic Data and Active Learning_. 

Link to DOI containing generated datasets, data pools used to generate datasets, real-world datasets and phenotype data outputs generated by the model: [10.5281/zenodo.13903900](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13903900).

Training and inference scripts in `train.sh` and `inference.sh`.

Dataset generation script available in `utils/generate_dataset.sh`, and takes arguments to a directory of images (containing a single object per image), an argument to a directory of masks (binary truth masks with the same names as the images folder with ``_mask.png`` as the suffix), and an argument to a directory of backgrounds.
